### Simple Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app. Buttons are not included, because it is a web app. I only have user data of 1, but I've found that it just slows me down when I try and click the buttons with a mouse. It's more visually familiar, reminding us of calculators we can hold and press, but functionally it might not be the best method for inputting numbers. Math operations are helpful though, so we can be sure what our calculator does. It could also be a bit less intuitive to use some more advanced math operators like log etc.

#### Future Steps

1. Add accurate division to a fixed decimal point. Currently any non whole numbers are rounded down.

2. Add additional math functionality. i.e. log, exponents, etc. Include these calculations into the array and a function to handle them accordingly. Very much just an expansion of previous work with Math.log() or Math.pow() etc.
