### Simple Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app. Buttons are not included, because it is a web app. I only have user data of 1, but I've found that it just slows me down when I try and click the buttons with a mouse. It's more visually familiar, reminding us of calculators we can hold and press, but functionally it might not be the best method for inputting numbers. Math operations are helpful though, so we can be sure what our calculator does. It could also be a bit less intuitive to use some more advanced math operators like log etc.
